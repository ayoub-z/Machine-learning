# Machine-learning (neural networks)
#### Repository for all machine learning assignments.

## Practicum 1:
Contains the following:
  - Perceptron (Perceptron unit. Basically a neuron that takes input and has weights)
  - PerceptronLayer (A single layer (in the network) that contains and handles multiple Perceptrons)
  - PerceptronNetwork (The neural network that holds each and every layer)
  - Main (Used to initialize Perceptrons/layers/network in order to test the code)
