# Machine-learning (neural networks)
#### Repository for all machine learning assignments.

## Practicum 1:
Contains the following:
  - Perceptron (Perceptron unit. Basically a neuron that takes input and has weights)
  - PerceptronLayer (A single layer (in the network) that contains and handles multiple Perceptrons)
  - PerceptronNetwork (The neural network that holds each and every layer)
  - Main (Used to initialize Perceptrons/layers/network in order to test the code)
-------------

## Practicum 2: 
Contains the following:
  - Perceptron that is able to adjust it's own weights and bias with the learning rule
  - Jupyter notebook to test and validate the trained networks.
-------------

## Practicum 3:
Contains the following:
  - Exactly the same as Practicum 1, except that it uses the Sigmoid activation function. <br/>
  - Weights and biases for the XOR and HALF ADDER are adjusted in the `main.py` in order to reach 0/1 outputs.
